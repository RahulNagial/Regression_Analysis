25,1 BR TOP FLOOR & BALCONY + IN-SUITE STORAGE IN QUIET BRICK BUILDING {VIDEO TOUR},Altadore,"This is a top floor South facing 1 bed/1 bath apartment, with a large living room with attached balcony, open-concept smaller kitchen with eating bar, and an area for a kitchen table. There’s also a large storage closet in the suite, additional bicycle storage in the hallway, and a shared laundry room. This is an older 8-unit brick building with quiet tenants. Dogs that are quiet and well behaved will be considered, as the previous landlord only allowed cats and we want to be mindful of noise. Parking is an assigned stall outdoors behind the building, and there is a power outlet for plugging in your car in the winter. This South-view unit in the back of the property, facing the parking area.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Bankview is a bustling Calgary community located somewhere between the definitions of downtown and inner-city. Offering the peaceful residential calm of a suburb with all of the amenities that living centrally affords, Bankview is the inner-city equivalent of having your cake and eating it too. Steps from the high culture offered by downtown's theater, symphony, and museums; Bankview's access to transit combined with its central location makes an evening on the town a simple pleasure instead of a big deal.
  Students will love the proximity to the University of Calgary, everyone will love the short commutes to work, school, and play alike. Keep active throughout the warmer months at the Calgary Tennis Club, and throughout the year along the Bow River Pathways. Great schools for the kids, plenty of activities for everyone with several pools, indoor and outdoor rinks, public golf courses, parks, and playgrounds throughout the area. Enjoy the change of scenery from downtown as Bankview's hills and valleys replace the cement greys of the city with sidestreet tree-borne greenery. Live sustainably and enjoy a car-free lifestyle as you walk or cycle through Bankview to the Community Garden to tend your fresh herbs and produce.
  Next to everything, something for everyone: Bankview is the right place to call home.

Some of the amenities of this great house are as follows: - A large shared backyard with the community house next door. The backyard is developed to grow fresh food, a stage for performances, and fire place for hanging out. - The ""back back"" is behind the fence but still ours to use (mostly for storage right now but we have ideas for use when snow melts) -There is a spacious kitchen for community meals and lots of shared foods. We have a shared fridge and an individual fridge. - 3 bathrooms, so you don't have to wait too long if at all to do yo thang - 2 fireplaces to enjoy in the long winter nights - 2 laundry rooms that ensure we all get our clothes clean on time - A production room for creating videos and other content to share online or in the community - An art/craft space for making all the amazing things - A book nook where you can find great books to stimulate your mind - An excersise area/room to get your sweat on or relax into your body with each asana -We will be having chalkboard paint on the walls to show who is home, what events we will have as well as free room to draw whatever you like!

We are 420 friendly though we don't smoke in the house for the most part. Except for ~Special moments~ Depending on how things go we may also be looking at shifting our gym into a grow room or an extra room for rent We are a mixed house with multiple perspectives which we share without judgment or ostracization. Acceptance of each other and community are important.
We are creating a space of love and openness and have biweekly heart circles to allow us all to build deeper understanding and connections to the people we are living with.

1086,2 BED/2 BATH CONDO IN TUXEDO PARK - PETS OK,-1,"Hi everyone,
I have a beautiful condo apartment for rent in Tuxedo Park, located on the top floor of a beautiful building. The building was built in 2012.
The property features a kitchen with granite, stainless steel, backsplash, and so on. It has two bedrooms, two full bathrooms and each bedroom has a walk in closet. The washer and dryer are located inside the apartment and are both front-loaders, and there is a reserved, underground, heated parking stall, an additional storage room in the underground, and also a designated bicycle storage compartment.
I installed an air conditioner unit in the master bedroom just a couple months ago.
The unit has in-floor radiant heating and hardwood throughout, and is fitted with a sprinkler based fire protection system.
The building uses FOB style swipe keys rather than master keys for entry, and every swipe is tracked in a database to prevent unauthorized access.
The apartment is located one block from centre street, where there is a bus stop and a direct bus route to down town, so if a person works down town there's no need to park the car in the city. The bus ride to down town would be 5 to 10 minutes, depending on which part of down town you're going to. Apart from the underground parking stall there is ample parking on the street as well. All landscaping, snow removal and lobby/hallway cleaning is of course provided.
The location is only two blocks away from Safeway, and there are many businesses and restaurants in the area, mostly on centre street and on 16th Avenue.
The unit provides a down town lifestyle without the noise and the traffic jams.
Pets are allowed but are subject to approval by the board of directors of the building. A cat or a small dog should be easy, large dogs could be more difficult but not impossible.
The pictures show some furniture (from when I lived there myself), but the place will be unfurnished.
If you're interested please send me a message.
Thank you,
Bart",288776,1,0,1,2012,2016,2.0,12.0,0.0,2.0,Condo,885,0, 2 ,2 ,1600

Imagine living life with everything steps outside your apartment door. At Park Central, you can! 
Grab your morning coffee just a stroll outside your door at boutique cafes. Next, enjoy your morning workout with city views, using state of the art workout equipment from Techno Gym. Free weights, cardio machines, squat racks, and ample space for any workout need. On top of that, enjoy a yoga and spin studio. Go ahead, cancel that gym membership. 
Even better, working from home just got easier with our coworking hub on the 8th floor. Meet like-minded neighbors and enjoy the Park Central community. Filled with tables, couches, and reading nooks, work just got more productive. 
We all know that if you work hard, you play hard. Park Central makes that easier with residents' own golf simulator, arcade games, tenant events, enjoy drinks with friends at the SkyLounge, and lastly Calgary's ONLY apartment rooftop pool. This is the place where residents come together and build lasting friendships! 
Park Central also has more amenities that you might not have known you were missing. Concierge service, front desk security, community manager, local art filling the spaces, and even a pet spa for your best friend! 
When and if you need to venture out you are in the middle of a bustling trendy Beltline community filled with restaurants, shops, parks, and pathways.

Imagine living life with everything steps outside your apartment door. At Park Central, you can! 
Grab your morning coffee just a stroll outside your door at boutique cafes. Next, enjoy your morning workout with city views, using state of the art workout equipment from Techno Gym. Free weights, cardio machines, squat racks, and ample space for any workout need. On top of that, enjoy a yoga and spin studio. Go ahead, cancel that gym membership. 
Even better, working from home just got easier with our coworking hub on the 8th floor. Meet like-minded neighbors and enjoy the Park Central community. Filled with tables, couches, and reading nooks, work just got more productive. 
We all know that if you work hard, you play hard. Park Central makes that easier with residents' own golf simulator, arcade games, tenant events, enjoy drinks with friends at the SkyLounge, and lastly Calgary's ONLY apartment rooftop pool. This is the place where residents come together and build lasting friendships! 
Park Central also has more amenities that you might not have known you were missing. Concierge service, front desk security, community manager, local art filling the spaces, and even a pet spa for your best friend!

1486,QUIET 1 BEDROOM CONDO WITH UNDERGROUND HEATED PARKING - CENTRAL CALGARY,Kingsland,"This very spacious 1 bedroom condo is perfect for a single person or couple as it is close to everything you would need and the unit features all necessities. For rent by owner.

Located near to Elbow Drive and Mcleod Trail, my place is nicely situated within walking distance to Chinook and Heritage train stations, many bus routes, Chinook mall, a plethora of restaurants and the Glenmore Resovoir.

The fully equipped kitchen has stainless steel appliances and plenty of storage space for food and equipment. The sizable balcony has a gas line hook-up for compatible natural gas BBQ's as well. Probably most enticing about this place is the secured, heated underground parking spot, I know I love it during the winter. Also included is a 6'x3' locked storage locker in the basement for easy storage of things like sports equipment or camping gear.

The building is professionally managed by MCM Property Management with 24 hour recorded security cameras at every entrance, FOB main entry and key locked unit door. There is an on-site locked garage for garbage, recycling and compost just outside the west end of the building beside the dedicated and enforced visitor parking stalls. Available if wanted/needed are bike rack rentals in the underground parkade for an additional 60$ a year.

-The Rental Agreement
-Rental Checklist
-Undertaking Tenant Form
